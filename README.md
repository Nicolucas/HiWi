## Description 
Pedagogical: 

### start using Specfem3DGlobe (wave propagation code for the cluster) Specfem3D Globe -> Bernard Schubert // use Supermuc Req Heiner

### Introduction for Dyamic Rupture large scale (using teleseismic data?)

input hd5 files using location and momentum.
2 models:
- one in sumatra earth
- 2006 new zealand
We can think of getting the slip rate

-- representation for point source representation - source inversion - ge radiation-> mimic slip 
--- Instaseis
--- we want to model the seismic / surface waves, we also want to account for gravity so we have a better fit for observations
---- Maybe using Specfem ()

We might use low frequency data so we can use 


### Introduction for Kenneth Duru Method to solve pseudospectral method?
